# Bing Conversation

**Human:**

 Write a content script for a chrome extension that automatically determine and set the writing direction of the focused input element.
In addition, the user will be able to override the writing direction, meaning to set it to rtl if the right control and the right shift keys are pressed, and to ltr if the left control and left shift keys are pressed.
When a writing direction is set by the extension, it should should also align the text alignment to "start".
It should log to the console whenever a direction switch occurs.
It should change the writing direction only if the focused element is editable.
The automatic direction ability will work as follows: while the user is typing inside a focused input field, check what is the first word character (ignore non-word characters) and if it's a word character of an RTL language, set the text direction accordingly, or set it to LTR otherwise.
If the user had set the text direction explicitly using the shortcut, stop using the auto-direction ability.
If the user cleared the input field, re-enable the auto detection mode.

 Generate a markdown file that describes my experience developing a software using the output of bing's chat AI.
These are the main points:
- I have prior knowledge of developing extensions for browsers
- At first, I've requested the bot to generate a javascript function that flips the writing direction. To my surprise, the code worked!
- I then requested to create a chrome extension that does the same, but the generated code had unnecessary parts like a background script and permissions that were unneeded
- Each time I've requested a change to remove or change some parts of the output, I saw that I will hit the chat depth limitation of 20 prompts very soon, before I'll have a chance to continue develop the main logic
- I decided to concentrate on the content script file and to request its generation by using a single large prompt
- After the creation of the content script file, I tweaked my original prompt, wiped the conversation regenerated the file again
- I iterated like that for a few times, until I thoght the generated code is a solid basis to continue from there
- I've copied the output to a folder on my PC and loaded the extension to Chrome
- Each iteration of fixes, I commited the code using git and used the prompt as the commit message
Pain points:
- I lost the chat a few times (closed the tab, forbidden word, chat limits, etc.) and it was like starting a conversation with another person that never saw the current code
- You can paste a piece of code and request to change it, but you are limited to 2000 chars
Tips:
- Save and update crucial prompts and keep them updated, so you'll be able to "load" the context to new chat conversations
- If the chat response was interrupted due to a response length limitiation, you can request the bot to continue from where it stopped
- Sometimes, the bot will decide that you've requested something forbidden and will stop the conversation. Try to pin down what word caused it and retry.

# Developing a Chrome Extension with Bing Chat AI

In this post, I will share my experience of developing a Chrome extension that automatically determines and sets the writing direction of the focused input element using Bing Chat AI. Bing Chat AI is a chat mode of Microsoft Bing search that can understand and communicate fluently in various languages and generate content such as poems, stories, code, essays, songs, celebrity parodies and more.

## Background

I have prior knowledge of developing extensions for browsers, so I was curious to see if Bing Chat AI could help me with this task. I wanted to create an extension that would allow me to write in both left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL) languages without having to manually switch the writing direction every time. In addition, I wanted to have the option to override the writing direction using keyboard shortcuts.

## The Process

At first, I’ve requested the bot to generate a JavaScript function that flips the writing direction of the current input element. To my surprise, the code worked! Here is the code snippet that the bot generated:

```
// This function flips the writing direction of the current input element

on my PC and loaded the extension to Chrome. I tested it on various websites and input fields and it worked as expected. I was able to write in both LTR and RTL languages and switch the writing direction using the keyboard shortcuts. The extension also aligned the text alignment to "start" and logged to the console whenever a direction switch occurred. It also detected the first word character of the input and set the writing direction accordingly, unless I had set it explicitly using the shortcut. If I cleared the input field, it re-enabled the auto detection mode.

## Pain Points

The process was not without challenges. I faced some pain points along the way, such as:

- I lost the chat a few times (closed the tab, forbidden word, chat limits, etc.) and it was like starting a conversation with another person that never saw the current code.
- I could paste a piece of code and request to change it, but I was limited to 2000 characters.
- Sometimes, the bot would decide that I've requested something forbidden and would stop the conversation. I had to try to pin down what word caused it and retry.

## Tips

To overcome these pain points, I learned some tips that might be useful for anyone who wants to use Bing Chat AI for developing software:

- Save and update crucial prompts and keep them updated, so you'll be able to "load" the context to new chat conversations.
- If the chat response was interrupted due to a response length limitation, you can request the bot to continue from where it stopped.
- Avoid using words that might trigger the bot's safety mechanism, such as "kill", "hack", "steal", etc.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I think Bing Chat AI is a powerful tool that can help developers with generating code and content for various purposes. It is not perfect, but it is impressive and fun to use. It can save time and effort, as well as inspire new ideas and solutions. I recommend giving it a try and see what you can create with it.

**Human:**

 The 3rd bullet in the "Tips" section is wrong. I didn't use those words. The word "developer" for example in the context of generating the "Pain Points" section, ended the conversation. Update that bullet accordingly

**Assistant:**
Here is a possible update for the 3rd bullet in the “Tips” section:



- Avoid using words that might trigger the bot’s safety mechanism, even if they are not harmful in your context. For example, I found out that the word “developer” in the context of generating the “Pain Points” section ended the conversation. Try to use synonyms or rephrase your prompt if that happens.

**Human:**

 Add a bullet to the "Pain Point section that describes that the same prompt might result different code

**Assistant:**
Here is a possible bullet to add to the “Pain Point” section:



- The same prompt might result in different code each time I regenerated the file. Sometimes the code was better, sometimes it was worse. I had to compare and choose the best version manually.





***

**Human:**

 Add a bullet to the "Pain Point section that describes that trying to tell the bot that there's something specific about the style that needs to be fixed in a generated function sometimes lead to non-working code. For example, I've requested to add comments, and it produced non working code due to line breaks where not allowed
